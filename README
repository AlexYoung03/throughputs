For "normal" LSST baseline evaluations, use the files in "baseline". 
 y4 is now the baseline y filter, so is called simply 'y' in this directory. 

For SRD evaluations of limiting magnitudes where X=1.0 is the desired atmosphere, use srd-1777. 

The files in 'imsim' are related to the throughputs used in the imsim simulations. 

Megacam and sdss should be self-explanatory. 

The directory 'atmos' contains various airmass atmospheres. 

More information is available in README files within each directory.
