# From Docushare-1777, v1.0, March 2010. 

The throughput curves in this directory are the ones currently in use in
the LSST SRD document. Note that these are subject to change as our knowledge
of the LSST systems improve and prototypes become available. 

m1.dat, m2.dat, m3.dat represent the current mirror throughputs used in the SRD.
lens1.dat, lens2.dat, lens3.dat represent the current lens throughputs ""
filter_u / g / r / i / z / y2 / y3 / y4. dat represent the current filter (filter only!) 
  throughput curves used in the SRD. Note that y4 is the current baseline filter, and 
  y2 is depreciated. Likely y3 will be depreciated shortly. 
detector.dat is the current detector sensitivity in the SRD.

system_*.dat throughput curves represent the combination of all of the above components.

atmos_10.dat is the atmosphere throughput likely at LSST at 1.0 airmasses. Note that 
 all further throughput curves which include atmosphere (i.e. total_*.dat) use THIS atmosphere
 which corresponds to a zenith observation. 

total_*.dat throughput curves represent the combination of all components in the LSST 
  system - mirrors, lenses, filter, detector, and the zenith atmos_10.dat atmosphere. 

All curves are in nanometers, with throughput represented by a number between 0 and 1.
